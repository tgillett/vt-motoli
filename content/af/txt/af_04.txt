##Page 1
#Page1Line1-0#    Long, long ago, the Sky God, Nyame, kept all stories locked in
#Page1Line1-1#    a wooden box, high in the sky.
#Page1Time1#		3.0

#Page1Line2#  People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. 
#Page1Time2#		2.0

#Page1Line3#  They asked Anansi the clever Spider to help them.
#Page1Time3#		1.5

##Page 2
#Page2Line1-0#  Anansi spun a long thread, and climbed 
#Page2Line1-1#  up his sticky thread all the way to heaven. 
#Page2Time1#		3.0

#Page2Line2#  "Can I have the stories, please?" he asked the Sky God.
#Page2Time2#		2.0

#Page2Line3-0#    But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said,
#Page2Line3-1#    "Oh, these are very expensive stories.
#Page2Line3-2#    You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider."
#Page2Time3#		4.0

##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#  "How much do the stories cost?" asked Anansi.
#Page3Time1#		2.0

#Page3Line2#  "You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals," Nyame answered,
#Page3Time2#		2.5

#Page3Line3-0#  "A leopard with sharp teeth like spears, a hornet that stings people,
#Page3Line3-1#   and a snake that swallows people whole."
#Page3Time3#		3.5

#Page3Line4#    He laughed and laughed. He thought his stories were quite safe. 
#Page3Time4#		3.0

##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#    So Anansi climbed slowly back down his
#Page4Line1-1#    sticky thread to the earth.
#Page4Time1#		2.5

#Page4Line2#    He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan.
#Page4Time2#		2.5

#Page4Line3-0#  He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt
#Page4Line3-1#  so it was hidden, and he went home for supper.
#Page4Time3#		3.5

#Page4Line4-0#  In the morning, sure enough,
#Page4Line4-1#  a leopard had fallen into his pit.
#Page4Time4#		3.5

#Page4Line5-0#  He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit
#Page4Line5-1#  but he couldn't get out.
#Page4Time5#		3.5

##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#  "Oh let me help you, my dear friend!" said Anansi. 
#Page5Line1-1#   "Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out." 
#Page5Time1#		7.2

#Page5Line2-0#  Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks,
#Page5Line2-1#  and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God.
#Page5Time2#		5.5

#Page5Line3#   But Nyame just laughed and said, "Where are the other two?"
#Page5Time3#		5.5

##Page 6
#Page6Line1#  So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. 
#Page6Time1#		4.2

#Page6Line2#  He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan.
#Page6Time2#		4.2

#Page6Line3-0#  He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree
#Page6Line3-1#  where the hornets lived.
#Page6Time3#		9.1

#Page6Line4#   He poured out some of the water all over their nest.
#Page6Time4#		9.0

#Page6Line5-0#  Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head,
#Page6Line5-1#  and he poured the rest of the water all over himself.
#Page6Time5#		9.0

##Page 7
#Page7Line1#  He called out to the hornets, "Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining!  
#Page7Time1#		7.0

#Page7Line2#  Quick get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry." 
#Page7Time2#		7.0

#Page7Line3#  Hornets don't like to get wet, so they all flew into Anansi's gourd. 
#Page7Time3#		3.0

##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#    Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening
#Page8Line1-1#    so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed.
#Page8Time1#		2.0

#Page8Line2#  He carried them up to heaven and showed them to the Sky God.  
#Page8Time2#		3.0

#Page8Line3-0#  But Nyame just said, "Where's the last one?"
#Page8Line3-1#  (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.)
#Page8Time3#		3.0

##Page 9
#Page9Line1-0#  So Anansi went down to earth again. 
#Page9Line1-1#  He thought and thought and he thought,
#Page9Line1-2#  but he couldn't come up with a plan.
#Page9Time1#		4.0

#Page9Line2#   So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. 
#Page9Time2#		2.0

#Page9Line3#   Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. 
#Page9Time3#		3.0

#Page9Line4-0#   When they got near the stream where the snake lived,
#Page9Line4-1#   they began to argue. 
#Page9Time4#		3.0

#Page9Line5#   "The branch is longer!" 
#Page9Time5#		1.0

#Page9Line6#   "No, it isn't!" 
#Page9Time6#		1.0

#Page9Line7#   "Yes it is!" 
#Page9Time7#		1.0

#Page 10
#Page10Line1#   Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was.
#Page10Time1#		3.0

#Page10Line2-0# "I was arguing with my wife," said Anansi. 
#Page10Line2-1# "She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree."
#Page10Time2#		4.0

#Page10Line3# "Of course I'm longer than that stick!" said the snake. 
#Page10Time3#		2.5

#Page10Line4-0# "I'm very long! I'm a huge snake!
#Page10Line4-1# Just put your stick next to me and measure!" 
#Page10Time4#		2.5

##Page 11
#Page11Line1-0# So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake
#Page11Line1-1# to the stick with his vine to keep him straight.
#Page11Time1#		2.5

#Page11Line2-0#   When he was all tied up,
#Page11Line2-1#   Anansi took the snake up to heaven.
#Page11Time2#		2.0

##Page 12
#Page12Line1# Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price.
#Page12Time1#		2.0

#Page12Line2-0#   So he went to his wooden box, opened the lid,
#Page12Line2-1#   and gave all the stories to Anansi.  
#Page12Time2#		2.5

#Page12Line3# Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. 
#Page12Time3#		2.0

#Page12Line4-0# He shared them with his wife,
#Page12Line4-1# and with all the other animals and people.
#Page12Time4#		3.5

#Page12Line5# 	Stories are for telling, not for keeping in wooden boxes.
#Page12Time5#		2.5
