#Page2Line1-0#  One day, Hare said, “My friend Hyena,|
#Page2Line1-1#  let us start farming together and we will be rich.”
#Page2Time1#		4.5

#Page2Line2-0#  “Oh yes, we can plant a lot of food,| harvest it,|
#Page2Line2-1#  and sell it to others,” Hyena said.
#Page2Time2#		4.2

#Page2Line3#“   But what shall we plant?” asked Hare.

#Page3Line1-0#  Hyena suggested that it was good to plant maize.|
#Page3Line1-1#  Hare agreed.
#Page3Time1#		4.0

#Page3Line2-0#  Hare also told Hyena that it was good for
#Page3Line2-1#  them to share duties on the farm.
#Page3Time2#		4.2

#Page3Line3-0#  “My work will be guarding the maize from birds,”
#Page3Line3-1#  said Hare.
#Page3Time3#		3.0

#Page3Line4#    Then Hare told Hyena to till the land, plant, and weed.
#Page3Time4#		2.7

##Page 4
#Page4Line1#    Hyena complained that he had been given more work.
#Page4Time1#		2.5

#Page4Line2-0#  But Hare told Hyena that the work of chasing birds
#Page4Line2-1#  was the most difficult and most important.
#Page4Time2#		3.5


#Page4Line3-0#  “My work is not easy.| I will be climbing
#Page4Line3-1#  trees and chasing birds away day and night.
#Page4Time3#		3.0

#Page4Line4-0#  And you are not able to climb a tree,” Hare
#Page4Line4-1#  explained
#Page4Time4#		2.7


##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#  Hyena was convinced by Hare's words.|
#Page5Line1-1#  He agreed to till the land alone.|
#Page5Line1-2#  It was a lot of work.| Hare did not help at all.
#Page5Time1#		7.2


#Page5Line2-0#  After tilling the land,| Hyena planted maize in
#Page5Line2-1#  the whole field,| alone.
#Page5Time2#		5.5


##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#  When weeds grew in the field,|
#Page6Line1-1#  Hyena used a hoe to weed.||
#Page6Line1-2#  It was a lot of work.
#Page6Time1#		4.2

#Page6Line2-0#  Hare sat on a rock singing:|
#Page6Line2-1#  “My friend is a worker,| I am his adviser'|
#Page6Line2-2#  He works like a tractor,| I am his manager.
#Page6Time2#		9.1

#Page6Line3-0#  The soil he toils,| the hills he tills,|
#Page6Line3-1#  The seeds he plants,| the weeds he cuts,|
#Page6Line3-2#  The maize we harvest.”
#Page6Time3#		9.0


##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#  When the maize was almost ready,|
#Page7Line1-1#  Hare enjoyed himself singing in the field 
#Page7Line1-2#  to keep birds away.
#Page7Time1#		6.0

#Page7Line2-0#  Chasing the birds was not a hard job.|
#Page7Line2-1#  He did not sweat at all.
#Page7Time2#		2.5


##Page 8
#Page8Line1#    Finally,| the maize was ready to harvest.
#Page8Time1#		2.0

#Page8Line2-0#  Hare told Hyena that they would share the harvest 
#Page8Line2-1#  between themselves.
#Page8Time2#		3.0

#Page8Line3-0#  Hare said,| “I will harvest everything that grows 
#Page8Line3-1#  above the soil,| and you will harvest everything 
#Page8Line3-2#  that grows below the soil.”
#Page8Time3#		7.0

#Page8Line4#    Hyena thought that it was a good idea.
#Page8Time4#		2.0

#Page9Line1-0#  Hare said,| “I will first get my harvest 
#Page9Line1-1#  then you will harvest yours.”
#Page9Time1#		4.0

#Page9Line2-1#  and put it in his store.
#Page9Time2#		4.0


#Page 10
#Page10Line1#   Hyena went to harvest things that grew below the soil.

#Page10Line3-1# He did not find anything to harvest.

#Page11Line2#   He returned home carrying empty baskets.
#Page11Time2#		2.0

#Page11Line3#   In the evening he went to Hare’s home very annoyed.

#Page12Line1-0# Hyena told Hare, “This time I will harvest
#Page12Line1-1# everything that grows above the ground, and you  
#Page12Line1-2# will harvest everything that grows below the soil.”
#Page12Time1#		10.0

#Page12Line2#   Hare accepted. 
#Page12Time2#		1.5

#Page12Line3-0# He told Hyena that instead of planting maize,|
#Page12Line3-1# it was good to change the crop. 
#Page12Time3#		6.0

#Page12Line4# 	They agreed to plant potatoes.
#Page12Time4#		2.5

#Page13Line1-0# Hyena also insisted that this time they would both
#Page13Line1-1# do the digging,| planting and weeding.
#Page13Time1#		7.0

#Page13Line2-0# Hare accepted. 
#Page13Line2-1# So they worked on the farm together,| singing.
