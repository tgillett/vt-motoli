#Page14Line1-1#		to graze.
#Page14Time1#		3.15
#Page14Line2#		They ran onto a neighbour's farm.
#Page14Time2#		2.1
#Page14Line3#		The farmer was angry with Odongo.
#Page14Time3#		2.1
#Page14Line4-0#		He threatened to keep the cows for eating his
#Page14Line4-1#		crops.
#Page14Time4#		3.5
#Page14Line5-0#		After that day, the boy made sure that the cows
#Page14Line5-1#		did not get into trouble again.

##Page 17
#Page17Line1-0#		But too soon the holidays were over and the
#Page17Line1-1#		children had to go back to the city.
#Page17Time1#		5.95
#Page17Line2-0#		Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap and Apiyo a
#Page17Line2-1#		sweater.
#Page17Time2#		3.15
#Page17Line3#		She packed food for their journey.
#Page17Time3#		2.1
 
##Page 18
#Page18Line1-0#		When their father came to fetch them, they did
#Page18Line1-1#		not want to leave.
#Page18Time1#		4.55
#Page18Line2-0#		The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them
#Page18Line2-1#		to the city.
#Page18Time2#		3.85
#Page18Line3#		She smiled and said, "I am too old for the city."
#Page18Time3#		3.85
#Page18Line4-0#		"I will be waiting for you to come to my village
