#Page1Line1-0#		Grandma's garden was wonderful - full of sorghum,
#Page1Line1-1#		millet, and cassava.
#Page1Time1#		3.5
#Page1Line2#		But best of all were the bananas.
#Page1Time2#		2.45
#Page1Line3-0#		Although Grandma had many grandchildren, I
#Page1Line3-1#		secretly knew that I was her favourite.
#Page1Time3#		4.55
#Page1Line4#		She invited me often to her house.
#Page1Time4#		2.45
#Page1Line5#		She also told me little secrets.
#Page1Time5#		2.1
#Page1Line6-0#		But there was one secret she did not share with
#Page1Line6-1#		me: where she ripened bananas.
#Page1Time6#		5.25
 
##Page 2
#Page2Line1-0#		One day I saw a big straw basket placed in the
#Page2Line1-1#		sun outside Grandma's house.
#Page2Time1#		5.25
#Page2Line2-0#		When I asked what it was for, the only answer I
#Page2Line2-1#		got was, "It's my magic basket."
#Page2Time2#		5.95
#Page2Line3-0#		Next to the basket, there were several banana
#Page2Line3-1#		leaves that Grandma turned from time to time.
#Page2Time3#		5.6
#Page2Line4#		I was curious.
#Page2Time4#		1.05
#Page2Line5#		"What are the leaves for, Grandma?" I asked.
#Page2Time5#		2.8
#Page2Line6-0#		The only answer I got was, "They are my magic
#Page2Line6-1#		leaves."
#Page2Time6#		3.85
 
##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#		It was so interesting watching Grandma, the
#Page3Line1-1#		bananas, the banana leaves and the big straw basket.
#Page3Time1#		5.6
#Page3Line2#		But Grandma sent me off to my mother on an errand.
#Page3Time2#		3.85
#Page3Line3#		"Grandma, please, let me watch as you prepare...".
#Page3Time3#		2.8
#Page3Line4-0#		"Don't be stubborn, child, do as you are told,"
#Page3Line4-1#		she insisted.
#Page3Time4#		3.85
#Page3Line5#		I took off running.
#Page3Time5#		1.4
 
##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#		When I returned, Grandma was sitting outside but
#Page4Line1-1#		with neither the basket nor the bananas.
#Page4Time1#		5.25
#Page4Line2-0#		"Grandma, where is the basket, where are all the
#Page4Line2-1#		bananas, and where...".
#Page4Time2#		4.2
#Page4Line3-0#		But the only answer I got was, "They are in my
#Page4Line3-1#		magic place."
#Page4Time3#		4.55
#Page4Line4#		It was so disappointing!
#Page4Time4#		1.4
 
##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#		Two days later, Grandma sent me to fetch her
#Page5Line1-1#		walking stick from her bedroom.
#Page5Time1#		4.9
#Page5Line2-0#		As soon as I opened the door, I was welcomed by
#Page5Line2-1#		the strong smell of ripening bananas.
#Page5Time2#		5.95
#Page5Line3-0#		In the inner room was grandma's big magic straw
#Page5Line3-1#		basket.
#Page5Time3#		3.5
#Page5Line4#		It was well hidden by an old blanket.
#Page5Time4#		2.8
#Page5Line5#		I lifted it and sniffed that glorious smell.
#Page5Time5#		2.8
 
##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#		Grandma's voice startled me when she called,
#Page6Line1-1#		"What are you doing? Hurry up and bring me the stick."
#Page6Time1#		6.3
#Page6Line2#		I hurried out with her walking stick.
#Page6Time2#		2.45
#Page6Line3#		"What are you smiling about?" Grandma asked.
#Page6Time3#		2.45
#Page6Line4-0#		Her question made me realise that I was still
#Page6Line4-1#		smiling at the discovery of her magic place.
#Page6Time4#		5.95
 
##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#		The following day when grandma came to visit my
#Page7Line1-1#		mother, I rushed to her house to check the bananas once more.
#Page7Time1#		7.35
#Page7Line2#		There was a bunch of very ripe ones.
#Page7Time2#		2.8
#Page7Line3#		I picked one and hid it in my dress.
#Page7Time3#		3.15
#Page7Line4-0#		After covering the basket again, I went behind
#Page7Line4-1#		the house and quickly ate it.
#Page7Time4#		4.9
#Page7Line5#		It was the sweetest banana I had ever tasted.
#Page7Time5#		3.15
 
##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#		The following day, when grandma was in the garden
#Page8Line1-1#		picking vegetables, I sneaked in and peered at the bananas.
#Page8Time1#		6.65
#Page8Line2#		Nearly all were ripe.
#Page8Time2#		1.4
#Page8Line3#		I couldn't help taking a bunch of four.
#Page8Time3#		2.8
#Page8Line4-0#		As I tiptoed towards the door, I heard grandma
#Page8Line4-1#		coughing outside.
#Page8Time4#		3.85
#Page8Line5-0#		I just managed to hide the bananas under my dress
#Page8Line5-1#		and walked past her.
#Page8Time5#		4.9
 
##Page 9
#Page9Line1#		The following day was market day.
#Page9Time1#		2.1
#Page9Line2#		Grandma woke up early.
#Page9Time2#		1.4
#Page9Line3-0#		She always took ripe bananas and cassava to sell
#Page9Line3-1#		at the market.
#Page9Time3#		4.2
#Page9Line4#		I did not hurry to visit her that day.
#Page9Time4#		3.15
#Page9Line5#		But I could not avoid her for long.
#Page9Time5#		2.8
 
##Page 10
#Page10Line1-0#		Later that evening I was called by my mother and
#Page10Line1-1#		father, and Grandma.
#Page10Time1#		4.55
#Page10Line2#		I knew why.
#Page10Time2#		1.05
#Page10Line3-0#		That night as I lay down to sleep, I knew I could
#Page10Line3-1#		never steal again, not from grandma, not from my
#Page10Line3-2#		parents, and certainly not from anyone else.
#Page10Time3#		9.8
