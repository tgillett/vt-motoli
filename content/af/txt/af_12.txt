#Page1Line1-0#		In a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East
#Page1Line1-1#		Africa, a little girl worked in the fields with her mother.
#Page1Time1#		7.7
#Page1Line2#		Her name was Wangari.
#Page1Time2#		1.4
 
##Page 2
#Page2Line1#		Wangari loved being outside.
#Page2Time1#		1.4
#Page2Line2-0#		In her family's food garden she broke up the soil
#Page2Line2-1#		with her machete.
#Page2Time2#		4.55
#Page2Line3#		She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth.
#Page2Time3#		2.8
 
##Page 3
#Page3Line1#		Her favourite time of day was just after sunset.
#Page3Time1#		3.15
#Page3Line2-0#		When it got too dark to see the plants, Wangari
#Page3Line2-1#		knew it was time to go home.
#Page3Time2#		5.95
#Page3Line3-0#		She would follow the narrow paths through the
#Page3Line3-1#		fields, crossing rivers as she went.
#Page3Time3#		4.9
 
##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#		Wangari was a clever child and couldn't wait to
#Page4Line1-1#		go to school.
#Page4Time1#		4.2
#Page4Line2-0#		But her mother and father wanted her to stay and
#Page4Line2-1#		help them at home.
#Page4Time2#		4.9
#Page4Line3-0#		When she was seven years old, her big brother
#Page4Line3-1#		persuaded her parents to let her go to school.
#Page4Time3#		6.3
 
##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#		She liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more
#Page5Line1-1#		with every book she read.
#Page5Time1#		4.9
#Page5Line2-0#		She did so well at school that she was invited to
#Page5Line2-1#		study in the United States of America.
#Page5Time2#		6.3
#Page5Line3-0#		Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more
#Page5Line3-1#		about the world.
#Page5Time3#		3.85
 
##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#		At the American university Wangari learnt many
#Page6Line1-1#		new things.
#Page6Time1#		3.15
#Page6Line2#		She studied plants and how they grow.
#Page6Time2#		2.45
#Page6Line3-0#		And she remembered how she grew: playing games
#Page6Line3-1#		with her brothers in the shade of the trees in
#Page6Line3-2#		the beautiful Kenyan forests.
#Page6Time3#		7.7
 
##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#		The more she learnt, the more she realised that
#Page7Line1-1#		she loved the people of Kenya.
#Page7Time1#		5.25
#Page7Line2#		She wanted them to be happy and free.
#Page7Time2#		2.8
#Page7Line3-0#		The more she learnt, the more she remembered her
#Page7Line3-1#		African home.
#Page7Time3#		3.85
 
##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#		When she had finished her studies, she returned
#Page8Line1-1#		to Kenya.
#Page8Time1#		3.5
#Page8Line2#		But her country had changed.
#Page8Time2#		1.75
#Page8Line3#		Huge farms stretched across the land.
#Page8Time3#		2.1
#Page8Line4#		Women had no wood to make cooking fires.
#Page8Time4#		2.8
#Page8Line5#		The people were poor and the children were hungry.
#Page8Time5#		3.15
 
##Page 9
#Page9Line1#		Wangari knew what to do.
#Page9Time1#		1.75
#Page9Line2-0#		She taught the women how to plant trees from
#Page9Line2-1#		seeds.
#Page9Time2#		3.5
#Page9Line3-0#		The women sold the trees and used the money to
#Page9Line3-1#		look after their families.
#Page9Time3#		4.9
#Page9Line4#		The women were very happy.
#Page9Time4#		1.75
#Page9Line5-0#		Wangari had helped them to feel powerful and
#Page9Line5-1#		strong.
#Page9Time5#		3.15
 
##Page 10
#Page10Line1-0#		As time passed, the new trees grew into forests,
#Page10Line1-1#		and the rivers started flowing again.
#Page10Time1#		5.25
#Page10Line2#		Wangari's message spread across Africa.
#Page10Time2#		1.75
#Page10Line3-0#		Today, millions of trees have grown from
#Page10Line3-1#		Wangari's seeds.
#Page10Time3#		3.15
 
##Page 11
#Page11Line1#		Wangari had worked hard.
#Page11Time1#		1.4
#Page11Line2-0#		People all over the world took notice, and gave
#Page11Line2-1#		her a famous prize.
#Page11Time2#		4.55
#Page11Line3-0#		It is called the Nobel Peace Prize, and she was
#Page11Line3-1#		the first African woman ever to receive it.
#Page11Time3#		6.3
 
##Page 12
#Page12Line1-0#		Wangari died in 2011, but we can think of her
#Page12Line1-1#		every time we see a beautiful tree.
