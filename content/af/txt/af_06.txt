##Page 1
#Page1Line1-0#    Hyena and Raven were once great friends,
#Page1Line1-1#    even though they were quite different in some ways.
#Page1Time1#		2.2
#Page1Line2#    Raven could fly but Hyena was only able to walk.
#Page1Time2#		2.2

##Page 2
#Page2Line1-0#  One day Hyena, curious to know something about his friend, asked Raven, 
#Page2Line1-1#  "What is this white thing which is always below your neck?" 
#Page2Time1#		2.1

##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#  Raven answered, "It is the fatty meat which I usually eat in the sky.
#Page3Line1-1#  I have been eating it for so long now it is stuck on my neck."
#Page3Time1#		3.0
#Page3Line2-0#  On hearing about meat, saliva started pouring out of Hyena's
#Page3Line2-1#  mouth for he was greedy and he loved meat very much.
#Page3Time2#		3.0
#Page3Line3-0#  Hyena really wanted to eat that meat. But how could he
#Page3Line3-1#  reach the meat in the sky if he had no wings to fly?
#Page3Time3#		3.0
#Page3Line4-0#  "Please my friend," he asked Raven, "lend me some feathers so that I
#Page3Line4-1#  can make myself some wings. I really want to be able to fly like you."
#Page3Time4#		3.0

##Page 4
#Page4Line1#  Raven was not mean, so he gave him some feathers.
#Page4Time1#		3.0
#Page4Line2#  Hyena sewed them together into wings.
#Page4Time2#		2.5
#Page4Line3-0#  He fastened them to his body, and
#Page4Line3-1#  tried to take off into the sky.
#Page4Time3#		2.5
#Page4Line4#  But he was far too heavy for the few feathers to carry him.
#Page4Time4#		2.5
#Page4Line5#  So he had to think of another plan.
#Page4Time5#		2.0

##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#  "Please my friend," he asked Raven, "could I hold
#Page5Line1-1#  onto your tail as you fly up into the sky?"
#Page5Time1#		3.0
#Page5Line2-0#  "All right," said Raven. "I know how much you
#Page5Line2-1#  want to fly. Let's do it tomorrow morning."
#Page5Time2#		3.0
#Page5Line3-0#  When day came, Hyena took hold of Raven's tail
#Page5Line3-1#  and Raven flew up into the sky.
#Page5Time3#		3.0

##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#  Raven flew and flew and flew until he was exhausted.
#Page6Line1-1#  But Hyena said, "Just a little further, my friend!"
#Page6Time1#		3.0
#Page6Line2-0#  He could see the white and fatty meat just above them,
#Page6Line2-1#  and his mouth was watering.
#Page6Time2#		3.0

##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#  When they reached the first piece of fatty meat, Hyena felt a jerk. 
#Page7Line1-1#  One of Raven's tail feathers came off in his hand!
#Page7Time1#		3.0
#Page7Line2-0#  Then there was another jerk, and another.
#Page7Line2-1#  Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in his tail was going. 
#Page7Time2#		3.0
#Page7Line3-0#  He sang: Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves.
#Page7Line3-1#  Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves. 
#Page7Time3#		3.0
#Page7Line4#  In response, Hyena sang the opposite:
#Page7Time4#		3.0
#Page7Line5-0#  Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves.
#Page7Line5-1#  Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves. 
#Page7Time5#		3.0

##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#  Finally, the feathers could not hold Hyena anymore.
#Page8Line1-1#  He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky.
#Page8Time1#		3.1
#Page8Line2-0#  He jumped onto the fatty meat thinking that as he ate,
#Page8Line2-1#  the fatty meat would hold him.
#Page8Time2#		3.1
#Page8Line3-0#  But as he tried to hold and eat the 'meat',
#Page8Line3-1#  all he felt was moist cloud!
#Page8Time3#		3.1

##Page 9
#Page9Line1#  By now he was falling fast. "Help, help!" he shouted.
#Page9Time1#		2.3
#Page9Line2#  But no one could hear him. Raven was lost in the clouds.
#Page9Time2#		2.3

##Page 10
#Page10Line1-0#  Hyena fell on the ground with a crash
#Page10Line1-1#  and lay silent for some minutes.
#Page10Time1#		3.0
#Page10Line2-0#  He woke up howling in pain, with a broken leg
#Page10Line2-1#  and dark scars all over his body.
#Page10Time2#		3.0

#Page 11
#Page11Line1-0#   From that day to now, Hyena limps and
#Page11Line1-1#   he has many scars on his body.
#Page11Time1#		3.0
#Page11Line2#   He has never been able to fly.
#Page11Time2#		2.0
#Page11Line3#   And he and Raven are no longer friends.
#Page11Time3#		2.0
