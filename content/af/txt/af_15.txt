##Page 1
#Page1Line1#		Once upon a time, Hen and Eagle were friends.
#Page1Time1#		3.15
#Page1Line2#		They lived in peace with all the other birds.
#Page1Time2#		3.15
#Page1Line3#		None of them could fly.
#Page1Time3#		1.75
 
##Page 2
#Page2Line1#		One day, there was famine in the land.
#Page2Time1#		2.8
#Page2Line2#		Eagle had to walk very far to find food.
#Page2Time2#		3.15
#Page2Line3#		She came back very tired.
#Page2Time3#		1.75
#Page2Line4-0#		"There must be an easier way to travel!" said
#Page2Line4-1#		Eagle.
#Page2Time4#		3.5
 
##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#		After a good night's sleep, Hen had a brilliant
#Page3Line1-1#		idea.
#Page3Time1#		3.5
#Page3Line2-0#		She began collecting the fallen feathers from all
#Page3Line2-1#		their bird friends.
#Page3Time2#		3.85
#Page3Line3-0#		"Let's sew them together on top of our own
#Page3Line3-1#		feathers," she said.
#Page3Time3#		4.2
#Page3Line4#		"Perhaps that will make it easier to travel."
#Page3Time4#		2.8
 
##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#		Eagle was the only one in the village with a
#Page4Line1-1#		needle, so she started sewing first.
#Page4Time1#		5.6
#Page4Line2-0#		She made herself a pair of beautiful wings and
#Page4Line2-1#		flew high above Hen.
#Page4Time2#		4.55
#Page4Line3-0#		Hen borrowed the needle but she soon got tired of
#Page4Line3-1#		sewing.
#Page4Time3#		3.85
#Page4Line4-0#		She left the needle on the cupboard and went into
#Page4Line4-1#		the kitchen to prepare food for her children.
#Page4Time4#		6.3
 
##Page 5
#Page5Line1#		But the other birds had seen Eagle flying away.
#Page5Time1#		3.15
#Page5Line2-0#		They asked Hen to lend them the needle to make
#Page5Line2-1#		wings for themselves too.
#Page5Time2#		4.9
#Page5Line3#		Soon there were birds flying all over the sky.
#Page5Time3#		3.15
 
##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#		When the last bird returned the borrowed needle,
#Page6Line1-1#		Hen was not there.
#Page6Time1#		4.2
#Page6Line2-0#		So her children took the needle and started
#Page6Line2-1#		playing with it.
#Page6Time2#		3.85
#Page6Line3-0#		When they got tired of the game, they left the
#Page6Line3-1#		needle in the sand.
#Page6Time3#		4.9
 
##Page 7
#Page7Line1#		Later that afternoon, Eagle returned.
#Page7Time1#		1.75
#Page7Line2-0#		She asked for the needle to fix some feathers
#Page7Line2-1#		that had loosened on her journey.
#Page7Time2#		5.25
#Page7Line3#		Hen looked on the cupboard.
#Page7Time3#		1.75
#Page7Line4#		She looked in the kitchen.
#Page7Time4#		1.75
#Page7Line5#		She looked in the yard.
#Page7Time5#		1.75
#Page7Line6#		But the needle was nowhere to be found.
#Page7Time6#		2.8
 
##Page 8
#Page8Line1#		"Just give me a day," Hen begged Eagle.
#Page8Time1#		2.8
#Page8Line2-0#		"Then you can fix your wing and fly away to get
#Page8Line2-1#		food again."
#Page8Time2#		4.55
#Page8Line3#		"Just one more day," said Eagle.
#Page8Time3#		2.1
#Page8Line4-0#		"If you can't find the needle, you'll have to
#Page8Line4-1#		give me one of your chicks as payment."
#Page8Time4#		5.95
 
##Page 9
#Page9Line1-0#		When Eagle came the next day, she found Hen
#Page9Line1-1#		scratching in the sand, but no needle.
#Page9Time1#		5.6
#Page9Line2-0#		So Eagle flew down very fast and caught one of
#Page9Line2-1#		the chicks.
#Page9Time2#		4.2
#Page9Line3#		She carried it away.
#Page9Time3#		1.4
#Page9Line4-0#		Forever after that, whenever Eagle appears, she
#Page9Line4-1#		finds Hen scratching in the sand for the needle.
#Page9Time4#		5.6
 
##Page 10
#Page10Line1-0#		As the shadow of Eagle's wing falls on the
#Page10Line1-1#		ground, Hen warns her chicks.
#Page10Time1#		4.9
#Page10Line2#		"Get out of the bare and dry land.
#Page10Time2#		2.8
#Page10Line3#		And they respond: "We are not fools. We will run."
#Page10Time4#		2.0
